### Slide 3 
Most of the details of our system were covered in the midterm presentation but as an overview, the system aims to provide a citizen centric approach to human resource management. There are two main users.

Citizens can input their occupational data and access a variety of resources through our portal. This includes job opportunities, job trends and predictions, and learning materials for upskilling.

Then, city managers can use the system as a tool for human resource management. It allows city managers to view detailed reports on their workforce, prioritizing citizen data. By leveraging this bottom-up, data-driven approach, city managers can dynamically respond to evolving career demands and city needs. 


### Slide 4 
The architectural structure of our system is split into three parts, user interface presentation tier, backend services application tier, and database data tier across thre logical host groups. The structure metaphor here is like a three tier cake.
