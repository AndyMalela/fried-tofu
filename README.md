# Billions must write

Fuck notion, fuck obsidian, fuck evernote. 

This personal repository acts as centralized location for backing up and transferring files or notes between all my devices. I use this because it's free.

## Contents

This repository is structured to include various types of files and notes.

## Backup Strategy

To ensure all data is safely backed up:
- **Regular Commits:** Commit changes regularly after adding new notes or files.
- **Branching:** Use branches for different semesters or major updates.
- **Remote Backup:** Push changes to a remote repository to keep an off-site backup.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal backup repository, contributions are not expected. 

## License

This repository is for personal use and does not contain any licensed material. Any shared resources should respect copyright laws.
