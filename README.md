# Billions must write

Fuck notion, fuck obsidian, fuck evernote. 

This personal repository acts as centralized location for backing up and transferring files or notes between all my devices. I use this because it's free.

## Structure

This repository has a kitchen-sink-structure.

## Backup Strategy

To ensure all data is safely backed up:
- **Regular Commits:** Commit changes regularly after adding new notes or files.
- **Branching:** Use branches for different semesters or major updates.
- **Remote Backup:** Push changes to a remote repository to keep an off-site backup.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal backup repository, contributions are not expected. 

## Security

For the possible case of this repository to be made public, do not put any private information here.
